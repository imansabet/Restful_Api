# The Restful_Api project adheres to the following RESTful principles:

# Statelessness: 
Each API call is independent, and all necessary information is provided in the request, ensuring that the server does not retain any client session information between requests.

# Resource-Based URIs:
The API uses clear, resource-based URIs to identify resources, such as /api/resource/{id}, making the API intuitive and easy to navigate.

# HTTP Methods:

GET: Retrieves data from the server.
POST: Creates a new resource.
PUT: Updates an existing resource.
DELETE: Removes a resource.
# JSON Format:
The API exchanges data using JSON, ensuring lightweight and easily parsable communication.

# Error Handling:
Implements proper HTTP status codes for different outcomes (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found, 400 Bad Request), providing clear feedback on the result of API calls.

# HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State):
Although not always fully implemented, HATEOAS encourages the API to include hyperlinks in responses, guiding clients on what actions are available next.
# Versioning:
The API may include versioning in its URI (e.g., /api/v1/resource) to manage different versions of the API, allowing for backward compatibility and gradual updates.

By adhering to these principles, the Restful_Api ensures a scalable, maintainable, and user-friendly API design that aligns with modern web development practices.
